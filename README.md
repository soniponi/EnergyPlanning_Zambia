# Electricity-Planning-Zambia
This project models and analyzes the electricity planning for Zambia, focusing on six scenarios to achieve sustainable energy by 2030:
1. **BAU**: Business as Usual.
2. **STEPS**: Stated Policies Scenario.
3. **Announced Pledges**: Optimistic projections based on governmental commitments.
4. **Diversification**: Reducing reliance on hydroelectric power (<50% share by 2030).
5. **Mini Grids**: Improving rural electrification with standalone systems.
6. **HRES Mini Grids**: Net-zero emission microgrids using hydrogen and renewable energy.

## ðŸ›  Tools and Technologies
- **Hypatia**: Python-based energy system modeling.
- **Gurobi**: Optimization solver.

## ðŸ“Š Key Results
